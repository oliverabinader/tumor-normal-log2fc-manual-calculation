Gene Mean Expression and log2 Fold Change between 2 groups 

This repository contains simple reusable R functions for:

- calculating mean expression values for selected genes across sample groups
- computing log2 fold-change between two groups from log2-normalized expression data

## Notes

The fold-change calculation assumes the expression data is already log2-normalized.  
Therefore, the difference in group means is reported as `log2_fc`.
